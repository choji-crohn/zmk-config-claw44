# zmk-config
This is my personal [zmk-config](https://zmk.dev/) for my [claw44](https://github.com/yfuku/claw44).
- JIS layout
- TAP and HOLD
- MACRO
- MOUSE KEY
- SLEEP
- SOFT OFF
- RGB UNDERGLOW for WS2812 STRIP
- INDICATOR LED WIDGET for nice!nano v2

## Modules
Additional feature(s) are provided by the following [modules](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules):
- [led_indicator](https://github.com/BlueDrink9/zmk-poor-mans-led-indicator) containing a simple widget that utilizes a (typically built-in, like nice!nano) LED controlled by a single GPIO. It is used to indicate battery level, layer, and BLE connection status in a very minimalist way.
