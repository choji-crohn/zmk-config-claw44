# zmk-config
This is my personal [zmk-config](https://zmk.dev/) for my [claw44](https://github.com/yfuku/claw44).

## Modules
Additional feature(s) are provided by the following [modules](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules):
- [zmk-poor-mans-led-indicator](https://github.com/BlueDrink9/zmk-poor-mans-led-indicator) to show the connection and battery status with the built-in LEDs of the Xiao BLE controller. Based on this, the module was adapted in led_indicator to be used with the single LED of the nice!nano.
